### What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating the structure and presentation of web pages. It is the fundamental building block of the World Wide Web and is understood by web browsers to render and display content.

HTML uses a set of tags to define the elements and structure of a web page. These tags are enclosed within angle brackets ("<>" symbols) and are placed within the content of the HTML document. The tags describe the purpose or type of content they enclose, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more.

### What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML-based languages like XHTML). It provides a way to control the visual appearance of web pages and applications.

With CSS, you can define various aspects of the presentation, such as colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and positioning of elements on a web page. It allows you to separate the presentation layer from the structure and content of the document, making it easier to maintain and update the styling of a website.

CSS works by associating style rules with HTML elements. A style rule consists of a selector and a set of declarations. The selector specifies which HTML elements the rule applies to, and the declarations define the styling properties and values for those elements.

CSS provides a wide range of properties and values that allow you to customize almost every aspect of the visual presentation. You can apply styles directly to HTML elements using inline CSS, embed CSS within the <head> section of an HTML document using <style> tags, or link an external CSS file to multiple HTML documents using the <link> tag.

By leveraging CSS, you can create consistent and visually appealing designs, implement responsive layouts, adapt styles for different devices and screen sizes, and enhance the user experience of your web pages. CSS is a key technology for modern web development and is often used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive websites.
